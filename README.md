# Advanced Elevator Control System

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a single-threaded, object-oriented elevator control system in Java. The system utilizes the Java collection framework for efficient floor request handling and dynamic movement direction adjustments. The primary goal was to create an efficient, maintainable, and modular codebase for managing elevator operations in a building.

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The system is designed using object-oriented principles to ensure modularity and maintainability.
- **Efficient Request Management**: Implemented an efficient request management system using a Map structure for smooth passenger onboarding, destination updates, and systematic unboarding.
- **Dynamic Movement Direction Adjustments**: The system dynamically adjusts the movement

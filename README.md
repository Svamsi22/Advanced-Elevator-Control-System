# Advanced Elevator Control System

**Project Duration:** May 2023 - June 2023  
**Project Mentor:** Y Hills

## Overview
This project involves the development of a single-threaded, object-oriented elevator control system in Java. The system efficiently handles floor requests and dynamically adjusts movement directions using the Java Collections Framework.

## Features
- **Single-Threaded Design:** Ensures simplicity and ease of debugging.
- **Object-Oriented Implementation:** Leverages Java's object-oriented principles for a modular and maintainable codebase.
- **Efficient Request Handling:** Utilizes Java's `Map` structure for managing passenger onboarding, destination updates, and unboarding.
- **Dynamic Movement Adjustment:** Adjusts elevator direction based on current and future requests.
- **User-Friendly Components:** Includes components for manual testing to demonstrate system functionality.
- **Rigorous Testing:** Simulated scenarios to validate optimal performance.

## Implementation Details
- **Language:** Java
- **Core Concepts:** Collection Framework, Map Structure, Object-Oriented Design, Single-Threaded Execution
- **Testing:** Comprehensive manual and simulated testing to ensure robust performance

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IDE or text editor of your choice

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Svamsi22/Advanced-Elevator-Control-System.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Advanced-Elevator-Control-System
    ```

### Usage
1. Compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac -d bin src/*.java
    ```
2. Run the main function to test the system:
    ```bash
    java -cp bin Main
    ```

### Project Structure
- **src/**
  - `Main.java`: Entry point for the application, demonstrating system functionality.
  - `Elevator.java`: Core class implementing the elevator's logic.
  - `RequestHandler.java`: Manages floor requests and updates elevator states.

## Testing
The system includes several manual tests and simulated scenarios to ensure all components function correctly. The main function serves as a demonstration and testing interface.
